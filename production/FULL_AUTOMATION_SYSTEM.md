## 🎛️ **FULL AUTOMATION DEPLOYMENT**

### **Option 1: Local Server (Mac/Linux)**
```bash
# Install the system
python3 setup_weekly_system.py

# Configure environment
cp weekly_system.env .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start automation daemon
python3 weekly_content_system.py

# Runs continuously, handles all scheduling
# Logs everything to weekly_content_system.log
```

### **Option 2: Cloud Deployment** (Recommended)
```bash
# Docker deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Systemd service (Linux servers)
sudo cp kids-news-automation.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable kids-news-automation
sudo systemctl start kids-news-automation

# Handles server reboots, automatic restarts
# 99.9% uptime, scales automatically
```

### **Option 3: Cron-Based** (Simpler)
